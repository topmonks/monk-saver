Simple OS X screen saver.

## Why

Because I can and I wanted to try to write one. Just to learn `ScreenSaver*`.

## Requirements

- OS X >= 10.10
- Xcode 7B2 (Swift 2.0)

## Issues

* No optimization at all (try to set it to 60fps and you'll see)

## Installation

Open project, build `Monk` target and double click on `Monk.saver` bundle in Finder.

## Debugging

It's quite hard to debug screen saver. To avoid multiple Macs, remote debugging, ... hassle
there's `Monk Demo` target, which runs same screen saver in window.
